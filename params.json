Computer algebra systems perform *automatic simplification* to convert expressions into a canonical form. In many computer algebra systems, it is a fundamental step around which the rest of the system is built. Symbolism can be called from F#. The implementation algorithms are ported from my other computer algebra project, MPL.\r\n\r\n## Experimental Music Compiler\r\n\r\n[Experimental Music Compiler](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/experimental-music-compiler/370af565-51c8-4cd0-af6a-32d1e9a6690a) is a Windows Phone app (versions 7 & 8) which generates algorithmic music in the [bytebeat](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/) genre. I wanted to experiment with bytebeat music on my Windows Phone but the JavaScript apps on the web didn't seem to play well with the WP browser. I wrote this app in C# and XAML to experiment with bytebeat songs directly on the phone.\r\n\r\n## MPL\r\n\r\n[MPL](https://github.com/dharmatech/mpl) is a library for computer algebra written in R6RS Scheme.\r\n\r\n## Box2d-Lite in Scheme\r\n\r\nBox2d is a popular C++ physics engine. Box2D-Lite is a lightweight version of Box2D. I [implemented a port](https://github.com/dharmatech/box2d-lite) of Box2D-lite to Scheme. These are not bindings to the C++ library. This is a complete, from scratch rewrite in 100% Scheme. One notable technique employed in this project was the implementation of macros which implement dot notation for accessing structure elements as well as calling methods on the structures.\r\n\r\n## Continuous integration system for Factor\r\n\r\nI implemented a continuous integration system for the Factor programming language project team. This system was written in Factor itself. The system is still being used by the Factor team.\r\n\r\n## Factor module system\r\n\r\nI designed and prototyped the module system for the Factor programming language. The design was accepted and implemented by the main developer.\r\n\r\n## Dataflow combinators for Factor\r\n\r\nI contributed the *cleave*, *spread*, and *apply* family of data flow combinators to the Factor programming language. More information on these combinators can be found in the official Factor [documentation](http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-dataflow-combinators.html).\r\n\r\n## Xlib bindings for Factor\r\n\r\nI implemented Factor bindings to the X Window System client library (xlib). These bindings were used to provide the Factor user interface on Linux and BSD systems. Developed the event dispatch system which was employed by the user-interface backend.\r\n\r\n# Employment\r\n\r\n**Ole Decor Magazine** South Padre Island, Texas - August 2012 - Present - Editor and accounts manager at an architecture and decor magazine which circulates in the Texas Rio Grande Valley. I also developed and maintain the [company's website](http://oledecor.com) in WordPress.\r\n\r\n**Stack Effects LLC** Minneapolis, Minnesota - January 2008 - January 2009 - Stack Effects was a startup company formed to apply the Factor language technology to emerging challenges in the web domain. I worked on various Factor libraries in support of the team. In particular, I designed and maintained a continuous integration system for the project team. I also designed the [fried quotations](http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-fry.html) language feature during my time at Stack Effects.\r\n\r\n**IBM/Tivoli Systems** Austin, Texas - December 1999 - May 2003 - Systems administrator for a software verification lab. Managed Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, and Windows NT servers and workstations in a test environment. Recreated customer scenarios in a lab environment.\r\n\r\n**Illuminati Online** June 1998 - December 1999 - Customer support engineer (phone & email) for an internet service provider in Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\n# Education\r\n\r\nStudied computer engineering at Texas A&M College Station for two years (1996-1998). Had a 3.5 GPA upon exit.\r\n\r\nHigh school dipoloma from Hanna High School in Brownsville, Texas.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
