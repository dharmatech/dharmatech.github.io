<h1>Software Projects</h1>

<h2>Symbolism</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dharmatech/Symbolism">Symbolism</a> is a C# library which implements automatic simplification of algebraic expresions. Computer algebra systems perform <em>automatic simplification</em> to convert expressions into a canonical form. In many computer algebra systems, it is a fundamental step around which the rest of the system is built. Symbolism can be called from F#. The implementation algorithms are ported from my other computer algebra project, MPL.</p>

<h2>Experimental Music Compiler</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/experimental-music-compiler/370af565-51c8-4cd0-af6a-32d1e9a6690a">Experimental Music Compiler</a> is a Windows Phone app (versions 7 &amp; 8) which generates algorithmic music in the <a href="http://canonical.org/%7Ekragen/bytebeat/">bytebeat</a> genre. I wanted to experiment with bytebeat music on my Windows Phone but the JavaScript apps on the web didn't seem to play well with the WP browser. I wrote this app in C# and XAML to experiment with bytebeat songs directly on the phone.</p>

<h2>MPL</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dharmatech/mpl">MPL</a> is a library for computer algebra written in R6RS Scheme.</p>

<h2>Box2d-Lite in Scheme</h2>

<p>Box2d is a popular C++ physics engine. Box2D-Lite is a lightweight version of Box2D. I <a href="https://github.com/dharmatech/box2d-lite">implemented a port</a> of Box2D-lite to Scheme. These are not bindings to the C++ library. This is a complete, from scratch rewrite in 100% Scheme. One notable technique employed in this project was the implementation of macros which implement dot notation for accessing structure elements as well as calling methods on the structures.</p>

<h2>Continuous integration system for Factor</h2>

<p>I implemented a continuous integration system for the Factor programming language project team. This system was written in Factor itself. The system is still being used by the Factor team.</p>

<h2>Factor module system</h2>

<p>I designed and prototyped the module system for the Factor programming language. The design was accepted and implemented by the main developer.</p>

<h2>Dataflow combinators for Factor</h2>

<p>I contributed the <em>cleave</em>, <em>spread</em>, and <em>apply</em> family of data flow combinators to the Factor programming language. More information on these combinators can be found in the official Factor <a href="http://docs.factorcode.org/content/article-dataflow-combinators.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Xlib bindings for Factor</h2>

<p>I implemented Factor bindings to the X Window System client library (xlib). These bindings were used to provide the Factor user interface on Linux and BSD systems. Developed the event dispatch system which was employed by the user-interface backend.</p>
